# Advanced-Topics-in-Neural-Networks-Car-Racing

We inspired from paper Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (Mnih, V., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., Graves, A., Antonoglou, I., Wierstra, D. and Riedmiller, M., 2013. Playing atari with deep reinforcement
learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602.) and implemented the DQN model for CarRacing_v2 environment from Gymnasium.
